that the boxes have been checked and the equipment's been tested - the NHS simply can't count on the gowns being available at the front line.\"\n\nMr Hopson gave the example of an expected consignment of 200,000 gowns from China which actually only contained 20,000 gowns when it arrived last week.\n\nMr Hopson added that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome, NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day.\n\n\"What we really need to get to is from the current rather hand-to-mouth approach to where sustainable supplies consistently and reliably arrive,\" he said.\n\nThe delay to the consignment is a real worry, both in the short and long-term.\n\nIt is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors.\n\nIt has left us depending on international supply - certainly for gowns - as we do not seem to be able to manufacture them ourselves.\n\nGiven the international demand for them, this threatens to be an on-going issue that could cause problems for months to come.\n\nStaff are understandably worried - they are putting their lives at risk.\n\nMinisters and their officials are clearly working hard to do what they can.\n\nBut in the future, serious questions will need to be asked about why this situation has arisen in the first place.\n\nThe NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across healthcare, said delays on the shipment from Turkey make \"a difficult situation worse\".\n\nIts chief executive Niall Dickson said \"it would have been better had the government not made the announcement in the first place\" regarding the order.\n\nPublic Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying \"some compromise\" was needed \"in times of extreme shortages\".\n\nMr Hopson said some trusts had taken to washing fluid-repellent gowns at 60C and had found, when washed a maximum three times, they remained resistant.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital show how health care workers put on PPE\n\nAlice Ushumba, who runs a healthcare service in Hampshire providing care to people in their own homes, said PPE is the \"biggest challenge\" her organisation faces.\n\nShe said she is struggling to get hold of enough masks and some staff had resigned because they didn't feel safe with the protective equipment available.\n\n\"We're going into people's houses who might have Covid but we don't have anything to protect ourselves except perhaps a little plastic apron and gloves,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One.\n\nGill Long, who runs a bespoke tailor in Hull, said she contacted the government several weeks ago to see if she could help make PPE for the NHS but heard nothing back.\n\nHowever, after approaching two local MPs she was put in contact with a nearby hospital and is hoping to make up to 250 gowns a day for them.\n\n\"It's just a shame we were offering weeks ago - it could have been done then,\" she told the same programme.\n\nThe BBC has identified 70 healthcare workers who have died with coronavirus since the start of the outbreak.\n\nThose from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds represented 42 out of 60 deaths, where it was possible to establish ethnicity.\n\nThe number of people who have died in UK hospitals with coronavirus has passed 16,000, with a further 596 deaths announced on Sunday.\n\nThe figure does not include those who died in care homes or in the community.\n\nBBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said while Sunday's figure was the lowest for nearly two weeks, figures often dropped at weekends because of delays in reporting and recording deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Charles opened a 2,000-bed field hospital at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The site - called Dragon's Heart Hospital - becomes Wales' biggest hospital.\n\nCharles' father, the Duke of Edinburgh, has made a rare public statement, praising those helping to tackle the pandemic and keeping essential services running.\n\nPrince Philip, 98, who retired from public duties in 2017, said he wanted to recognise the \"vital and urgent\" medical and scientific work taking place.\n\nIn his message, published online, the duke said: \"On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues.\"\n\nIn other developments:"}, {"published": "2020-04-20T15:17:26", "newspaper": "bbc", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52354865", "title": "Coronavirus: Virgin Atlantic will fold without aid, warns Branson", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nSir Richard Branson has warned that airline Virgin Atlantic needs government support to survive.\n\nThe boss of the Virgin Group said he was not asking for a handout, but a commercial loan, believed to be \u00a3500m.\n\nIn an open letter to staff, Sir Richard said: \"Many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it.\n\nThe plea comes as Virgin Australia, the country's second largest airline, faces going into administration without aid.\n\nSir Richard wrote in his letter that without UK government support for Virgin Atlantic \"there won't be any competition left and hundreds of thousands more jobs will be lost\".\n\nVirgin Atlantic - which is owned jointly by Sir Richard and US carrier Delta - has reportedly asked for \u00a3500m in aid. However, according to an FT report last week, the request has been rejected by the Treasury.\n\nIt said the airline had not done enough to show it had explored other options to bolster cash before asking for state aid.\n\nGovernment support\n\nIn his letter to staff, Sir Richard said: \"We will do everything we can to keep the airline [Virgin Atlantic] going - but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for.\n\n\"This would be in the form of a commercial loan - it wouldn't be free money and the airline would pay it back (as EasyJet will do for the \u00a3600m loan the government recently gave them).\"\n\nHe pointed out that Virgin Atlantic started with one plane 36 years ago, before adding: \"Over those years it has created real competition for British Airways, which must remain fierce for the benefit of our wonderful customers and the public at large.\"\n\nHe also said that he would use his luxury private Carribean island Necker as collateral to raise funds to save jobs at his businesses.\n\nSir Richard offered to inject \u00a3250m into the Virgin Group last month, with most of that going to the airline.\n\nEarlier this month, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group sent letters to the government highlighting the importance of Virgin Atlantic to the UK's manufacturing supply chain.\n\nAustralia struggles\n\nMeanwhile, it has been reported that Virgin Australia - in which Sir Richard holds a stake of around 10% - is close to going into administration after being refused help by the Australian government.\n\nThe carrier has been forced to cancel nearly all of its flights during the coronavirus crisis and been unable to restructure its debts.\n\nThe Australian government refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn (\u00a3720m) loan.\n\nThe airline - which employs about 16,000 - is part-owned by Sir Richard along with Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA.\n\n\"The brilliant Virgin Australia team is fighting to survive and need support to get through this catastrophic global crisis,\" Sir Richard said.\n\n\"We are hopeful that Virgin Australia can emerge stronger than ever, as a more sustainable, financially viable airline.\"\n\nHe warned: \"If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies. We all know what that would lead to.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSir Richard also addressed the fierce criticism he has faced in recent weeks over his tax situation.\n\nCritics have pointed out he has paid no UK income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago.\n\nSir Richard is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.2bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index.\n\n\"I've seen lots of comments about my net worth - but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,\" he said.\n\n\"Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities.\"\n\nTurning to the question of living abroad he said: \"Joan and I did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands (BVI) and in particular Necker Island, which I bought when I was 29 years old, as an uninhabited island on the edges of the BVI.\n\n\"Over time, we built our family home here.

Many studies have linked NO 2 exposure to health damage, and particularly lung disease, which could make people more likely to die if they contract Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThe results indicate that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the Covid-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world,\u201d said Yaron Ogen, at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany, who conducted the research. \u201cPoisoning our environment means poisoning our own body, and when it experiences chronic respiratory stress its ability to defend itself from infections is limited.\u201d\n\nThe analysis is only able to show a strong correlation, not a causal link. \u201cIt is now necessary to examine whether the presence of an initial inflammatory condition is related to the response of the immune system to the coronavirus,\u201d Ogen said.\n\nA separate study published on 7 April looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates. Another recent paper noted that the high death rates seen in the north of Italy correlated with the highest levels of air pollution.\n\nThe new research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, compared NO 2 levels in January and February in 66 administrative regions with Covid-19 deaths recorded up to 19 March. Ogen also assessed the atmospheric conditions to see where pollution was being trapped over the regions.\n\nHe found that 78% of the 4,443 deaths were in four regions in northern Italy and one around Madrid in Spain. These five regions had the worst combination of NO 2 levels and airflow conditions that prevented dispersal of air pollution.\n\nOgen noted that the Po Valley in Italy and Madrid were surrounded by mountains, which helps trap pollution, as is Hubei province in China, where the pandemic began. \u201cHowever, my research is only an initial indication that there might be a correlation between the level of air pollution, air movement and the severity of the course of the corona outbreaks,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, said the study showed an association between Covid-19 deaths and NO 2 levels. \u201cThis association could reflect a causal link between exposure to air pollution and increased vulnerability to fatal Covid infection, but other factors cannot be ruled out at this stage. For example, the study does not adjust for differences in age distribution in different areas.\u201d\n\nWidespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and air pollution. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution.\n\nIn the UK, NO 2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last decade. A key policy to reduce NO 2 levels is the introduction of clean air zones, where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the introduction of some CAZs has been postponed because of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nJenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis new study is worrying. We know NO 2 is a toxic gas that inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections, so it may not be surprising that people who have suffered in areas with high levels of NO 2 could be more susceptible to coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThis is all the more reason to keep traffic and pollution levels down as much as possible now and get out of this terrible situation with a view to fewer but cleaner vehicles on the road.\u201d"}, {"published": "2020-04-20T15:24:28", "newspaper": "theguardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nhs-frontline-meet-people-risking-lives-tackle-coronavirus", "title": "On the frontline: meet the NHS workers tackling coronavirus", "text": "\u201cWe\u2019re used to death \u2013 death is part of life in intensive care \u2013 but not in the kind of numbers that we\u2019re seeing, and that\u2019s really quite hard to take,\u201d says Tom Billyard, a consultant at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, as he reflects on the unprecedented challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn preparation for his latest 12-hour shift in ITU, where the worst affected patients are given life support, Billyard begins to don several layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) over his blue scrubs.\n\nFirst a pair of latex gloves, then a surgical hat.

We\u2019re also getting crews bringing in patients of various ages who are struggling to get breaths while they\u2019re on oxygen.\u201d\n\nThe West Midlands is one of the UK\u2019s most affected regions. At the time of writing, UCHW has admitted 568 patients with Covid-19 and recorded 161 deaths from it, while 316 patients have been discharged after making full recoveries. It has transferred its minor injuries unit to a neighbouring hospital, allowing it to prioritise the influx of Covid-19 patients.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Jones says, pausing at the severity of the symptoms she\u2019s treating. \u201cThe acuity of our patients has gone up so much.

Some lie in isolation rooms, texting friends and loved ones, others in wards of six beds; many seem in a state of shock and weariness, barely registering the world around them.\n\nPatients and staff on wards 30, 31 and 32.\n\nMark Anders, a local paramedic, was himself struck down by Covid-19. \u201cWe all joked about going to emergency coughs and high temperatures, because that\u2019s all we were going to.\u201d\n\nHe fell ill during a Saturday night shift. \u201cI got halfway through the shift and I said to my crew mate: \u2018I don\u2019t know what it is; I just don\u2019t feel right,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThen I got home and the temperature started. I had a week at home of self-isolating, looking after myself, taking paracetamol every four hours, fluids, just trying to do everything to keep my temperature down. After a week I couldn\u2019t control it. From there on: nightmare.\u201d\n\nAnders was lucky. As doctors readied him for transfer to ITU, his body began to fight back. Sitting in his pyjamas and still bearing bloody scars around his septum from the oxygen supply that kept him alive, he has been told he can soon return home to his family.\n\n\u201cMassive,\u201d he says, when asked about the value of the NHS. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been this ill in my life.

She treated Coventry\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d and has watched with concern as the virus has spread through the local community. She fears that it may also transition from patients to staff.\n\nFor much of her shift, she wears only an apron, gloves and surgical mask \u2013 the kind you would find in a dentist\u2019s surgery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she says. \u201cOur masks already have an expiry date on them and the NHS have covered up the existing expiry date with a further expiry date.

But it comes back to the key question: what is necessary? And then using it appropriately.\u201d\n\nEach procedure and each ward might require different levels of protection. In ITU patients might undergo aerosol procedures, which are more likely to spread Covid-19 particles through the air; hence the extra layers of protection worn by Billyard and his colleagues.\n\nApproximately 5,000 UHCW staff have so far been fit-tested for FFP3 masks since January and, though the hospital has plenty of PPE in stock, it relies on unpredictable army drops for replenishment. \u201cWe have to carefully manage it to ensure we have the longevity because this pandemic isn\u2019t going to be finished next week,\u201d Wells warns.\n\nPPE supplies; Tom Billyard adjusts the nose-bridge on a colleague\u2019s FFP3 mask.\n\nLei Dayrit, a nurse who worked at Hospital of St Cross in Rugby, UHCW\u2019s sister hospital, died from Covid-19-related complications last week. She was one of several nurses who treated an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient who later became symptomatic.\n\nHer death was mourned on Thursday evening during the weekly \u201cclap for carers\u201d gathering outside UHCW, where a banner was unfurled in her honour.\n\nWith tears in her eyes, the staff nurse Gail Hobley, a long-time colleague, said: \u201cShe was a special nurse to work with. Very caring, very supportive. We had a little discussion about Covid and she said everybody will look after each other, and we are. The support we have from everybody [in the community] is terrific.\u201d\n\nColleagues gather to mourn the death of Lei Dayrit, a nurse who died of Covid-19.\n\n___\n\nLoved and cared for\n\nIn the hospital\u2019s faith centre, the Rev John Matipano, one of the chaplains at UHCW, offers reassurance to those in need.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing rounds, supporting staff, and we\u2019ve had staff say: \u2018Please pray for us\u2019 \u2013 something that you would never imagine happening given the way people are quite private about their faith,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEven if we don\u2019t speak to staff, if you just go around ED and they see that a chaplain is here, they feel that someone cares, someone is there for them. Now, more than anything else, presence is very important.\u201d\n\nOf all the heartbreak caused by Covid-19, nothing compares with the inability of families to see \u2013 and say goodbye to \u2013 their loved ones in person. Only in ITU can a dying patient receive one visitor.\n\nSome patients have, at least, been able to communicate with friends and family via video conferencing apps on tablets donated to the hospital. Wells found this especially moving when her grandfather was admitted with Covid-19.\n\n\u201cHe was able to tell my family he loved them and to sign goodbye via FaceTime before he died,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew the staff on the ward he was on. They were amazing. They stepped up and fulfilled a role that we weren\u2019t able to fulfil. My mum feels happy that he was well loved and cared for.\u201d\n\n___\n\nA personal promise\n\n\n\nThroughout the hospital, one unexpected sound punctuates the silence: laughter. In these dark times, a joke between colleagues provides a flicker of normality to offset the stress.\n\nThierno Siedou Diallo, a cleaner, puts it simply: \u201cYou must come in and laugh. You give assurance to everybody.\u201d\n\nIn the medical decisions unit, Stacey Gavin, a band six sister in acute medicine, is sporting a \u201cbride to be\u201d sash. \u201cI was supposed to be in Benidorm this weekend for my hen do. About 13 of us were going, a mixture of family and friends. Unfortunately it got cancelled about a month ago. So I said if I\u2019m not going on my hen do, I\u2019ll bring my hen do to work.\n\n\u201cThe girls put on a little celebration at break time in the staff room. They got Shloer, pretending to be champagne!\u201d\n\nStacey Gavin, a sister in acute medicine, celebrating her hen do at work. Ash Patini, a volunteer.\n\nLike most staff, Gavin has offered to worked extra shifts, forgoing her annual leave. She and her colleagues are helped by a group of dedicated volunteers and charity workers, among them Ash Patini.\n\n\u201cI lost my mum 17 years ago to terminal cancer and that absolutely changed my views on life what I wanted to do. She was made to feel very, very happy and comfortable here, right to the very end. It\u2019s something I can never forget.\n\n\u201cI promised myself that one day I would give something back. I kept that vision for 17 years [until taking early retirement]. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m back here; that\u2019s why I do what I do.\u201d\n\nThe charity stock room is piled high with donations such as Easter eggs, crips, sweets, fruit bars and toiletries. Elsewhere, local manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover have supplied visors for hospital staff, while many nurses have been given homemade headbands to alleviate the sores caused by wearing face masks.\n\nVisors and head-guards given to the hospital.\n\n___\n\nPrivileged position\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the pandemic, significant changes were made throughout the hospital\u2019s infrastructure: wards were repurposed, staff retrained, junior doctors given greater responsibilities, and strategies put in place to manage the trajectory of the disease.\n\nKiran Patel, chief medical officer, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve probably had about 20 years\u2019 worth of transformation happen in the space of a month. And we\u2019ve probably had over 135 year-one to year-three students, and about 150 graduates, who have basically just hit the ground running and been brilliant.\u201d\n\nFollowing teleconferences with hospitals in China, Japan and Italy, UHCW has already prepared a reserve ITU ward of 32 beds and could raise capacity even higher, if needed. The hospital has also joined studies run by the World Health Organization.\n\nNicolas Aldridge, lead nurse for research and development, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at a mixture of anti-viral medications such as hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria medication. We\u2019re gaining large numbers of patients for research because most of the existing research is only from small samples.\u201d\n\nQuestioned on Donald Trump\u2019s recent support for the drug, despite limited evidence to support its efficacy in fighting Covid-19, Aldridge says diplomatically: \u201cIf we knew it would work, we wouldn\u2019t be doing research on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorically, I think the last vaccine took 15 years to create. But technology has moved a huge distance since then and so has our understanding of how vaccines work.\n\n\u201cWhen you step back at the end of the shift, you realise we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s of immense importance. We\u2019re in a privileged job where we can try to find a treatment for it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nQuick and painless\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, testing is critical. UHCW now has a dedicated swab-testing pod which can cater for up to 120 patients a day.\n\nInitially, testing was open to members of the public, but it has recently been scaled back to NHS staff and their families (members of the public can attend neighbouring centres).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very quick, relatively painless. It\u2019s just uncomfortable,\u201d says the modern matron Amanda Jarvis. \u201cIt\u2019s two swabs for an adult: nasal swab and throat \u2013 right at the back of the throat. It takes a couple of minutes.\u201d\n\nLeo Harris-Mortimer, four, is swab tested.\n\nAlex Mortimer, a paediatrician, has brought his four-year-old son, Leo Harris-Mortimer, for a test. Leo has had a dry cough for several days; Alex\u2019s wife had previously displayed symptoms, too.\n\n\u201cWith this particular illness, the profile is that the older population are much more vulnerable to it, but there are a number of case studies that show children have been infected and have been affected badly. So it\u2019s an important illness to take very seriously,\u201d he says.\n\nThe test result takes between 48 and 72 hours to arrive, meaning Mortimer could soon be back in an ambulance if his son gets the all clear. Were it not for this rapid testing, he would have to undergo a precautionary period of isolation, excluding him from service for weeks.\n\n___\n\nHalfway up Mount Everest\n\n\n\nBack in the dimly lit corridors surrounding ITU, nurses and consultants prepare to enter the highly infectious wards. Just like Billyard before them, they too must don \u2013 and later doff \u2013 every piece of equipment with the utmost precision, otherwise the risk of contaminating themselves, the safe zones and future patients is extreme.\n\nYellow and black hazard tape marks the flooring \u2013 tread on the wrong side of it and you will be quickly admonished \u2013 and white plastic sheets with red zippers seal the outer perimeter of the changing zone.\n\nEach person who enters ITU is likely to stay inside for three hours or more before they take a 20-minute break. The sweat caused by wearing so much plastic is instantaneous and the FFP3 masks irritate the nose and skin. Yet there can be no distractions in critical care, where half of all patients with Covid-19 will not survive.\n\n(The NHS says it hopes that by allowing a photojournalist to document the care provided in ITU, it may reinforce the need to stay at home and protect the NHS. Some viewers may find the following images distressing.)\n\nMedics in and around ITU, where signs warn of the extreme infection risk within.\n\nRoger Townsend is the clinical lead for ITU. \u201cWorking in the PPE is hot, uncomfortable, and because you can\u2019t take your mask off in the critical care area, you can\u2019t drink a glass of water,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the temptation to do one more job before you leave. So when you say to yourself: \u2018I\u2019ll wear this for two hours and then go out and have a drink and then come back in,\u2019 you find sometimes three, four hours have gone by or even longer.\u201d\n\nInside ITU, many patients are in comas and connected to a vast array of machinery \u2013 ventilators, monitors, infusion pumps and sometimes dialysis machines \u2013 while groups of nurses and doctors check their vital signs.\n\nNurses in ITU attend to their patients.\n\nHeart monitors flicker and nurses confer; Billyard wanders the ward, scanning for problems. Many of the patients he surveys are middle-aged.\n\nBehind a curtain, a patient is flipped on to their front \u2013 a process known as \u201cproning\u201d. It takes five people to roll one patient. Each of them has their name written across their front and back, because there would be no other way to recognise who was who.\n\nA patient is \u2018proned\u2019 \u2013 turned on to their front \u2013 to assist with breathing.\n\nIn another bay, one of the few conscious patients is wearing a pressurised breathing apparatus. His head is entirely encased.\n\n\u201cBy the time a patient comes to critical care, they have got the kind of oxygen levels that you would have not quite half way up Mount Everest,\u201d says Townsend, \u201cand that\u2019s on supplemental oxygen to push their oxygen levels up. If we didn\u2019t intervene then the oxygen levels in their blood would fall away and they would die. The intervention that we do is essentially buying some time for mother nature to fix things.\u201d\n\nThe hospital has two ITU wards and Townsend reveals the scale of the challenge when he says: \u201cNormally when we hand over at the end or beginning of the day, we might say that two or three patients are really sick, but right now we\u2019ve got 15 or 16 patients on each unit who I would say fit that definition. You do go home shell-shocked.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOne second closer\n\n\n\nFar away from the trauma of ITU, in a scientific laboratory filled with test tubes, refrigerators and unfathomable machines, Ranveer Singh Chaven, a bio medical scientist, is busy analysing results from Covid-19 swab tests.\n\n\u201cOptimism is everything, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t come to work. I\u2019m sure I speak for everyone here at the hospital when I say we\u2019ll work day and night.\u201d\n\nRanveer Singh Chaven, a bio medical scientist, and his phone, which shows how long it has been since he last gave his mum and niece a hug.\n\nHe digs into his pocket and shows me an app on his phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got a timer on my phone,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve seen my mum and given her a hug, or kissed my niece goodnight: 24 days, 10 hours, 26 minutes, 53 seconds.\u201d\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \u201cI keep that with me just to keep me going. If it brings me a second closer to seeing them ... that\u2019s why we do this.\u201d"}, {"published": "2020-04-20T16:06:01", "newspaper": "theguardian", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-live-news-us-deaths-pass-40000-as-italy-records-lowest-fatalities-in-a-week-latest-updates", "title": "Coronavirus live news: Spain proposes \u20ac1.5tn EU Covid-19 fund; US blocks pro-WHO statement by G20", "text": "15:22\n\nIn the UK, the Guardian is running a project to remember the NHS workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus.\n\nIf you would like to share any further names and stories with us, or feel there are people we have missed, then please drop an email to sarah.marsh@theguardian.com.

The chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Comittes of the Bundestag and the House of Commons make the case for a German-British Friendship Treaty. A guest column.\n\nEU-Supporters gather on Brexit-Day in front of the British Embassy in Berlin Bild: EPA\n\nMore than three years after the referendum, Brexit on Saturday became reality as the United Kingdom formally left the European Union. After 40 years of European integration and being an integral part of a community as tightly intertwined as the EU, this departure not only fundamentally changes the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU. It also requires us to rethink the bilateral relations between EU member states and the UK. While we have different perspectives on Brexit, we agree that it is now time to move on.\n\nMany aspects of our future relationship will be organized at the European level as part of the ongoing Brexit negotiations. But some issues are bilateral and require stronger direct ties. We think it\u2019s time for a German-British Friendship Treaty, which regulates enhanced cooperation and strengthens our shared values, cultural and educational policy and, yes, our foreign affairs. A treaty would complement whatever the UK agreed with the 27 member states and deepen our bonds.\n\nOne of the first consequences of Brexit will be that officials, ministers and parliamentarians from our two countries will no longer regularly meet in Brussels. We need to make sure understanding remains strong and encourage exchanges between us. Ramping up our embassy staff and the cultural and educational programmes run by institutions such as the Goethe Institute, the British Council or the German Academic Exchange Service can also change the tone.\n\nIrrespective of the UK\u2019s decision on remaining a full member of the Erasmus exchange programme after 2020, we should strengthen direct ties between German and British students and teachers and deepen scientific cooperation between our researchers. Creating new bilateral grants to fund joint projects no longer eligible for EU funding would promote collaboration and could culminate in shared clusters of excellence at German and British universities.\n\nShared enterprise will boost much more than science and the economy, it will further entwine our values. Germany and the United Kingdom are home to some of the most tolerant and open societies in the world. And yet racism in general, and anti-Semitism in particular, are on the rise in our societies. To counter this we should launch a joint, high profile project that fights intolerance and promotes solidarity.\n\nFor different reasons, taking a strong stance against anti-Semitism has particular importance for both societies: to Germans it is central to our historical responsibility for the horrors of the Second World War; to Britons forcefully condemning anti-Semitism it is a recognition of the proud history the UK has of providing refuge to Jews fleeing from prosecution and death in Nazi Germany. As important allies of Israel and on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the time to act is now.\n\nFinally, Germany and the United Kingdom have shared interests overseas. Our two countries stood together on every major international issue, from global trade to the Iran nuclear deal. We both recognise that we share a continent, values, making our security indivisible. Geography and geopolitics is not changed by Brexit. For both of us, security in the Middle East has direct implications for the stability of our own societies, and those of our neighbours. As part of a wider initiative, as Europeans, or within the E3 format alongside France, Germany and the UK will no doubt cooperate in political and military engagements in the region, from working to stabilize Iraq, to helping to support parties trying to bring peace to Libya.\n\nWith Britain\u2019s EU membership coming to an end it is time to look ahead and to create a strong foundation for our future bilateral relations. A German-British Friendship Treaty would provide a framework. It will be the first draft of the next chapter which we will write together."}, {"published": "2020-01-27T16:35:51", "newspaper": "faz", "link": "https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/ronald-s-lauder-s-speech-at-auschwitz-16603174.html", "title": "Ronald S.

Lauder at Auschwitz : The Girl With The Red Coat\n\nThe annihilation of the Jews in Auschwitz was perpetrated by Germans and Austrians. But it also happened because Europe und the United States did not care. What does this mean for the fight against Anti-Semitism today?\n\nYour Majesties, your Excellencies, Rabbis, Clergy, honored guests and, most importantly, the survivors of Auschwitz-Birkenau, who are with us today.\n\nThis is about you, the survivors and I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am that you are here and in some cases, here with your children and grandchildren. Five years ago, when I stood here, in front of these painful gates, I admitted that I am not a survivor: But I am so grateful for the survivors who are here today. I am not a liberator, although I salute the courage of the veterans who saved us all.\n\nI am here, simply, as a Jew. And, like all Jews everywhere, this place, this terrible place called Auschwitz has sadly become an inseparable part of us.\n\nAuschwitz is like a scar from a terrible trauma. It never goes away and the pain never stops. I have always wondered, if I had been born in Hungary, where my grandparents were from, instead of New York in February, 1944, would I have lived?\n\nThe answer is: no.\n\nI would have been one of the 438,000 Hungarian Jews gassed by the Nazis in 1944 right here in Auschwitz. I can assure you, almost all Jews have pondered this question.\n\n75 years ago today, when Soviet troops entered these gates, they had no idea what lay behind them. And since that day the entire world has struggled with what they found inside.\n\nWe have all wondered how an advanced country that gave the world great literature and art and scientific advancement, could sink to an anger, a meanness, a depravity like Auschwitz.\n\nI\u2019m afraid Auschwitz offers more questions than answers.\n\nBut let me be clear: While Germany and Austria caused, created and carried out this shattering evil practically every other European country helped the Nazis gather up their Jewish citizens. Too many people in too many countries made Auschwitz happen.\n\nAnd when European Jews begged the world for a safe harbor, someplace to go, the entire world turned its back on them.\n\nEven my own country - the beacon of freedom - turned out its light on the jewish people when they needed it the most.\n\nThe U.S. organized a conference in Evian, France, in July of 1938, to discuss the Jewish refugee crisis. There were a lot of lovely speeches but, the United States did not let any additional Jewish refugees in and every other country in attendance followed their lead.\n\nThere were 32 countries and none of them, except for the tiny Dominican Republic wanted anymore Jews. Hitler saw this. Four months later, came Kristallnacht.\n\nAnd again, there was no world reaction.\n\nHitler tested the world. And at every step he saw the truth: the world did not care. That\u2019s when he knew that he could build this factory of death.\n\nEvian led to Auschwitz. Kristallnacht led to Auschwitz. World Anti-Semitism led to Auschwitz.\n\nThankfully, there were some people throughout Europe who had a moral decency and who acted differently. Ordinary people who risked their lives and their family\u2019s lives, to save other human beings sometimes people they didn\u2019t even know.\n\nAt Yad Vashem in Jerusalem you will see 27,362 names of what we call: The Righteous Among Nations. Those gentiles, who risked everything to save Jewish lives. We have not forgotten these honorable men and women and we never will.\n\nFive years ago, at the 70th anniversary, I was very concerned about the shocking rise of Anti-Semitism here in Europe. Today, you all know the attacks on Jews, the killings, the vicious slanders have only grown worse, and they have even spread to my country.\n\n75 years ago, when the world finally saw the pictures of the gas chambers here and the piles of bodies, nobody in their right mind wanted to be associated with Nazis. But now, I see something I never thought I would see in my lifetime: The open and brazen spread of Anti-Jewish hatred throughout the world, once again."}, {"published": "2020-01-19T14:54:53", "newspaper": "faz", "link": "https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/netzkonferenz-dld/facebook-splitting-up-is-not-the-solution-16586463.html", "title": "Facebook: Splitting up is not the solution", "text": "The biggest disadvantage for European tech companies compared to their Chinese and American competitors is the absence of a large-scale domestic market. A guest contribution.\n\nEverybody agrees that the internet needs new rules \u2013 from those governing how people\u2019s private data is handled, or how the integrity of elections is preserved, to the mechanisms for allowing data to flow between companies and nation states or how harmful content is identified and taken down. These decisions will determine whether the norms and standards of the internet are created on a global level, preserving the open, accessible and universal internet of today, or whether individual countries will diverge further from each other, creating their own rules and systems, turning themselves into walled gardens and ending the universal global internet as we know it.\n\nBut we in Europe and the West are not the only ones grappling with decisions about the future of the internet. As we speak, there is a fight for the soul of the internet already underway. In fact, another internet already exists. The Chinese internet \u2013 one based on very different values: state control; censorship; and surveillance. And some other countries, to greater or lesser degrees, are beginning to follow China\u2019s lead.\n\nEurope may not have its own Silicon Valley, or be as advanced in large scale AI as China or the West Coast of the United States, but it is a thought leader when it comes to the future of the internet. GDPR was the first serious attempt to create a set of principles and rules around private data in the digital age. And those principles are at the heart of a vision for the internet that I believe is shared among all open societies: that it is accessible to all; transparent and accountable; that you control your own data; and that competition and innovation should be encouraged.\n\nFacebook wants to add its voice\n\nIn the US, the political debate is around whether big tech companies should be broken up. Here, in the EU, it is largely about how tech companies should be better regulated. In both cases, the fundamental question is the same: how can the power of large tech companies be held to account?\n\nFacebook wants to add its voice to this debate in a constructive way. We are not resisting regulation \u2013 the opposite, in fact. Regulating the tech sector is a far more effective way to ensure that tech serves the needs of society than simply chopping successful companies into bits. We have not only long accepted the need for new regulation in a host of areas, we are impatient to get going.\n\nIt is now time we moved beyond words and towards action. A new EU Commission is in post, a new Parliament has been elected, and a great regulatory challenge lies before us. My message to European policymakers is: Everyone agrees the internet needs new rules. We want them, just as you do. So let\u2019s get to work.\n\nOne area where we should work together is data portability. The reason is simple: if we want a competitive, open internet where new services can compete with large platforms like Facebook, we have to enable to people to move their data from one service to a competing one.\n\nYou're not giving us your data\n\nIt is a subject we have been working on with policymakers in Germany. Last year we held a series of round table discussions hosted by Stiftung Datenschutz and attended by government and industry representatives, privacy experts, civil society and data protection authorities, which resulted in a report that raised a number of questions and recommendations for how to move forward."}, {"published": "2020-01-19T11:10:00", "newspaper": "faz", "link": "https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/netzkonferenz-dld/quantum-tech-future-directions-16586824.html", "title": "Quantum Tech: Future Directions", "text": "These are early days in quantum technologies. It is clear, that this field will have a significant impact on a wide range of economic sectors.\n\nModel of the inside of a quantum computer Bild: Bastian Benrath\n\nWe are entering a new era which will catalyze discoveries in science and technology. Novel computing platforms will probe the fundamental laws of our universe and aid in solving hard problems that affect all of us. Machine learning programs powered by specialized chips are already yielding breakthrough after breakthrough.\n\nQuantum computing is part of the larger field of quantum information science (QIS). All three branches of QIS \u2013 computation, communication, and sensing \u2013 are advancing at rapid rates and a discovery in one area can spur progress in another.\n\nBusinesses and investors are now ramping up their interest in these fields. In this piece, we will first outline the various quantum technologies and then cover opportunities and impact. While these are early days in quantum tech, we can see exciting possibilities coming down the road. In the past three years alone, funds invested more than $650 million into quantum tech companies. The quantum tech ecosystem is growing rapidly in many geographies across the globe and is not dominated by just one or two locations.\n\nQuantum communication leverages the unusual properties of quantum systems to transmit information in a manner that no eavesdropper can read. This field is becoming increasingly critical as quantum computing drives us to a post-quantum cryptography regime: quantum computers of sufficient size will be able to break many cryptographic schemes currently in use, which means that new protocols will need to be developed and put into use.\n\nAn emerging class of sensors\n\nThere are quantum-resistant schemes currently being tested \u2013 for example, as part of the NIST process \u2013 for which there are no known quantum (or classical, for that matter) attacks. For ultimate security, however, it may be that some will choose to rely on new quantum communication protocols that make use of a new quantum internet. Those protocols will be guaranteed secure by the fundamental laws of physics, but will require new hardware beyond what we currently use for classical data transmission.\n\nQuantum sensing is a robust field of research that uses quantum devices to move beyond classical limits in sensing magnetic and other fields. For example, there is an emerging class of sensors for detecting position, navigation, and timing (PNT) at the atomic scale. These micro-PNT devices can provide highly accurate positioning data when GPS is jammed or unavailable.\n\nQuantum sensors also show promise in the life sciences. Researchers have already demonstrated the use of nanoscale quantum sensors to measure the electromagnetic activity of single cells. We can use these sensors to monitor the firing of neurons and cardiac cells. These technologies can develop into cornerstone diagnostic and therapeutic devices in the future.\n\nThe trick is to build such a system\n\nOne of the critical differences between quantum and classical computation is that in quantum computing we are manipulating quantum states themselves; this gives us a much larger computing space to work in than in classical computers. In classical computers, if we wish to model a real-world quantum physical we can only do so with representations of such a system and we cannot implement the physics itself. This key difference leads to exciting possibilities for the future of computing and science. All this starts with fundamental truths about our world that were developed during the quantum mechanics revolution in the first half of the 20th century"}]}, "japannews": {"link": "https://the-japan-news.com/", "articles": [{"newspaper": "japannews", "title": "The Japan News", "text": "Tokyo\n\n01:00 am 02:00 am 03:00 am 04:00 am 05:00 am 06:00 am 07:00 am 08:00 am 09:00 am 10:00 am 11:00 am 12:00 pm 01:00 pm 02:00 pm 03:00 pm 04:00 pm 05:00 pm 06:00 pm 07:00 pm 08:00 pm 09:00 pm 10:00 pm 11:00 pm", "link": "https://the-japan-news.com/news/japannotes/", "published": "2020-04-20T17:11:16.406768"}, {"newspaper": "japannews", "title": "Political News", "text": "G20 Osaka Agenda, June 28-29 / Negative effects of trade conflict will be major focus 8:25 pm, June 22, 2019\n\nThis is the first installment of a four-part series on the summit of the Group of 20 major economies in Osaka.
