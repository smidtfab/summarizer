bbc;Coronavirus: 'Low confidence' over arrival of PPE from Turkey;"Image copyright Getty Images

There is ""relatively low confidence"" a delayed delivery of 400,000 protective gowns will arrive on Monday, a senior NHS figure has said.

The consignment had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" some hospital trusts already had shortages of the gowns, which protect those treating coronavirus patients.

A minister said he was ""hopeful"" the Turkish flight would leave on Monday.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the government was ""working very hard"" to resolve the issue but added there had been ""challenges at the Turkish end"".

""I don't want to start making more and more promises but I understand that flight will take off this afternoon and those [gowns] will be delivered,"" he told BBC Breakfast.

Another 25 million gowns from China had also been procured and the UK would be ""getting those shortly as well"", he added.

Downing Street said the government had now delivered a billion pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline staff.

The prime minister's spokesman said delivery of gowns in particular was ""pressured at the moment"" and there was a ""global supply problem"".

He said the government was working to ensure the shipment is ""delivered as soon as it is ready"" but it was not only reliant on Turkey and had ""plenty more orders lined up and expected"".

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland currently had ""adequate stocks"" of all the main items of PPE but gowns were one of the items ""under most pressure"".

Mr Hopson, whose organisation represents healthcare trusts across England, said if the delayed consignment from Turkey did arrive on Monday it would ""probably arrive very late on in the day"".

""It just illustrates that we need to be careful about focusing on individual consignments,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""Bitter experience over the last few weeks has shown until a consignment of gowns has actually landed - that the boxes have been checked and the equipment's been tested - the NHS simply can't count on the gowns being available at the front line.""

Mr Hopson gave the example of an expected consignment of 200,000 gowns from China which actually only contained 20,000 gowns when it arrived last week.

Mr Hopson added that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome, NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day.

""What we really need to get to is from the current rather hand-to-mouth approach to where sustainable supplies consistently and reliably arrive,"" he said.

The delay to the consignment is a real worry, both in the short and long-term.

It is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors.

It has left us depending on international supply - certainly for gowns - as we do not seem to be able to manufacture them ourselves.

Given the international demand for them, this threatens to be an on-going issue that could cause problems for months to come.

Staff are understandably worried - they are putting their lives at risk.

Ministers and their officials are clearly working hard to do what they can.

But in the future, serious questions will need to be asked about why this situation has arisen in the first place.

The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across healthcare, said delays on the shipment from Turkey make ""a difficult situation worse"".

Its chief executive Niall Dickson said ""it would have been better had the government not made the announcement in the first place"" regarding the order.

Public Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"".

Mr Hopson said some trusts had taken to washing fluid-repellent gowns at 60C and had found, when washed a maximum three times, they remained resistant.

Alice Ushumba, who runs a healthcare service in Hampshire providing care to people in their own homes, said PPE is the ""biggest challenge"" her organisation faces.

She said she is struggling to get hold of enough masks and some staff had resigned because they didn't feel safe with the protective equipment available.

""We're going into people's houses who might have Covid but we don't have anything to protect ourselves except perhaps a little plastic apron and gloves,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One.

Gill Long, who runs a bespoke tailor in Hull, said she contacted the government several weeks ago to see if she could help make PPE for the NHS but heard nothing back.

However, after approaching two local MPs she was put in contact with a nearby hospital and is hoping to make up to 250 gowns a day for them.

""It's just a shame we were offering weeks ago - it could have been done then,"" she told the same programme.

The BBC has identified 70 healthcare workers who have died with coronavirus since the start of the outbreak.

Those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds represented 42 out of 60 deaths, where it was possible to establish ethnicity.

The number of people who have died in UK hospitals with coronavirus has passed 16,000, with a further 596 deaths announced on Sunday.

The figure does not include those who died in care homes or in the community.

BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said while Sunday's figure was the lowest for nearly two weeks, figures often dropped at weekends because of delays in reporting and recording deaths.

Meanwhile, Prince Charles opened a 2,000-bed field hospital at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The site - called Dragon's Heart Hospital - becomes Wales' biggest hospital.

Charles' father, the Duke of Edinburgh, has made a rare public statement, praising those helping to tackle the pandemic and keeping essential services running.

Prince Philip, 98, who retired from public duties in 2017, said he wanted to recognise the ""vital and urgent"" medical and scientific work taking place.

In his message, published online, the duke said: ""On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues.""

bbc;Coronavirus: Virgin Atlantic will fold without aid, warns Branson;"Image copyright Getty Images

Sir Richard Branson has warned that airline Virgin Atlantic needs government support to survive.

The boss of the Virgin Group said he was not asking for a handout, but a commercial loan, believed to be £500m.

In an open letter to staff, Sir Richard said: ""Many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it.

The plea comes as Virgin Australia, the country's second largest airline, faces going into administration without aid.

Sir Richard wrote in his letter that without UK government support for Virgin Atlantic ""there won't be any competition left and hundreds of thousands more jobs will be lost"".

Virgin Atlantic - which is owned jointly by Sir Richard and US carrier Delta - has reportedly asked for £500m in aid. However, according to an FT report last week, the request has been rejected by the Treasury.

It said the airline had not done enough to show it had explored other options to bolster cash before asking for state aid.

Government support

In his letter to staff, Sir Richard said: ""We will do everything we can to keep the airline [Virgin Atlantic] going - but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for.

""This would be in the form of a commercial loan - it wouldn't be free money and the airline would pay it back (as EasyJet will do for the £600m loan the government recently gave them).""

He pointed out that Virgin Atlantic started with one plane 36 years ago, before adding: ""Over those years it has created real competition for British Airways, which must remain fierce for the benefit of our wonderful customers and the public at large.""

He also said that he would use his luxury private Carribean island Necker as collateral to raise funds to save jobs at his businesses.

Sir Richard offered to inject £250m into the Virgin Group last month, with most of that going to the airline.

Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group sent letters to the government highlighting the importance of Virgin Atlantic to the UK's manufacturing supply chain.

Australia struggles

Meanwhile, it has been reported that Virgin Australia - in which Sir Richard holds a stake of around 10% - is close to going into administration after being refused help by the Australian government.

The carrier has been forced to cancel nearly all of its flights during the coronavirus crisis and been unable to restructure its debts.

The Australian government refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn (£720m) loan.

The airline - which employs about 16,000 - is part-owned by Sir Richard along with Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA.

""The brilliant Virgin Australia team is fighting to survive and need support to get through this catastrophic global crisis,"" Sir Richard said.

""We are hopeful that Virgin Australia can emerge stronger than ever, as a more sustainable, financially viable airline.""

He warned: ""If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies. We all know what that would lead to.""

Sir Richard also addressed the fierce criticism he has faced in recent weeks over his tax situation.

Critics have pointed out he has paid no UK income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago.

Sir Richard is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.2bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index.

""I've seen lots of comments about my net worth - but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,"" he said.

""Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities.""

Turning to the question of living abroad he said: ""Joan and I did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands (BVI) and in particular Necker Island, which I bought when I was 29 years old, as an uninhabited island on the edges of the BVI.

""Over time, we built our family home here. The rest of the island is run as a business, which employs 175 people.""";https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52354865;2020-04-20T15:17:26

Tributes have been paid to a ""one of a kind"" 84-year-old auxiliary nurse who died after contracting coronavirus.

Margaret Tapley had continued to work as a healthcare assistant at Witney Community Hospital in Oxfordshire.

She died on Sunday in hospital in Swindon, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust said.

Her grandson Ben Wood told BBC Radio 5 Live she ""had such a drive"" and ""gave her life and dedicated it towards the NHS"".

""That was the way she was, there would be no talking her out of it,"" he said.

""She had been working for just over 40 years doing three night shifts a week and she dedicated her life to the end.""

Kathryn MacLennan said her ""incredible"" grandmother was ""very aware"" of the risks posed by coronavirus but ""she could never imagine leaving her work family"".

She said Mrs Tapley started her career as a nurse after her children had grown up.

""She loved her job, in some ways it's horrible that it's happened but also it's nice for us all to know that she died doing the thing she loved,"" said Ms MacLennan, who is from Didcot.

The trust said Mrs Tapley worked her last shift on 10 April.

Her family said the grandmother of four had been experiencing symptoms of coronavirus before she was admitted to hospital on Thursday and died three days later.

""We always said she would outlive all of us with the energy she had and it is tragic her life has been cut short,"" Mr Wood said.

""She still had an awful lot to give.""

Mr Wood said he was grateful for the ""incredible"" response online to his grandmother's death.

""We always knew she was a very special, and it's amazing to see so many others are recognising that and paying tribute as well,"" he said.

Hannah Tapley, a high jumper who has competed for Team GB, said her grandmother was the ""strongest woman"" she had ever known.

Another of her grandchildren, Tom Wood - a senior charge nurse in an A&E department - described his Ms Tapley as his ""inspiration"".

Oxford Health chief executive Stuart Bell said Mrs Tapley ""embodied all that is best in those who work for the NHS"".

bbc;Texts sent by Meghan and Harry to her father revealed in court papers;"Image copyright Karwai Tang

The Duchess of Sussex has revealed text messages she and Prince Harry sent to her father before their wedding, as part of legal action against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday.

Meghan claims Associated Newspapers misquoted the messages to paint the couple in a less good light.

She also claims tabloids, in particular those owned by the group, caused a dispute between her and her father.

Associated Newspapers says it will defend the privacy claim ""with vigour"".

It comes as Meghan and Harry, who have relocated to California after stepping back as senior royals, told the UK's tabloid press that they are ending all co-operation with them.

Meghan brought the legal action after a handwritten letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, was published in the Mail on Sunday.

She claims the letter was selectively edited by the paper to portray her ""negatively"".

Court papers containing the text messages have been filed ahead of an expected hearing later this week.

The legal document claims they show the newspaper group edited the messages the Duke and Duchess of Sussex sent to Mr Markle before their wedding on 19 May 2018.

'Meg and I are not angry'

It said that on 5 May 2018 Meghan wrote in a text to her father: ""I've called and texted but haven't heard back from you so hoping you're okay"".

She then messaged her father the next day after finding out photographs of her father had been staged for a paparazzo photographer, the document said.

""She explains that she had attempted to arrange logistics and supplies for her father discretely and with privacy, with care taken not to feed the press, that she is trying to protect her father from heightened press intrusion and scrutiny and that he should keep a low profile until the wedding,"" it says.

On 14 May 2018, it says, Mr Markle sent Meghan a text message to apologise and confirm that he would not be attending the wedding.

It says that around half an hour later, after several calls to Mr Markle went unanswered, Prince Harry sent the following messages to Mr Markle from Meghan's phone:

""Tom, it's Harry and I'm going to call you right now. Please pick up, thank you""

""Tom, Harry again! Really need to speak to u. U do not need to apologize, we understand the circumstances but ""going public"" will only make the situation worse. If u love Meg and want to make it right please call me as there are two other options which don't involve u having to speak to the media, who incidentally created this whole situation. So please call me so I can explain. Meg and I are not angry, we just need to speak to u. Thanks""

""Oh any speaking to the press WILL backfire, trust me Tom. Only we can help u, as we have been trying from day 1"".

The legal document claimed the newspaper's summary of these messages contained ""significant omissions"" when it ""merely"" reported that the messages said ""Mr Markle did not need to apologise and that he should call"".

It adds the description of another exchange ""intentionally omits"" any reference to Meghan or Prince Harry attempting to protect Mr Markle and ensure that he was safe.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The duke and duchess married at Windsor in May 2018

The document also states that the UK tabloid media, particularly Associated Newspapers, harassed, humiliated and manipulated Mr Markle.

Meghan alleges the newspaper group caused the very ""dispute"" which they claim justified the publication of the letter and also caused ""substantial damage"" to their relationship.

She accuses the paper of misusing her private information, breaching copyright and selective editing when it published the private letter to her father.

The Mail on Sunday has said there was ""huge and legitimate"" public interest in publishing the letter.

The paper argues that members of the Royal Family, including the Duchess of Sussex, ""rely on publicity about themselves and their lives in order to maintain the privileged positions they hold and promote themselves"".

It claims Meghan ""did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that the contents of the letter were private and would remain so"".

As evidence that it did not infringe her privacy, the paper said the letter was ""immaculately copied"" in Meghan's ""elaborate handwriting"", arguing that this care in its presentation meant she anticipated it would be seen and read by a wider audience.";https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52354898;2020-04-20T15:42:52
theguardian;Air pollution may be ‘key contributor’ to Covid-19 deaths – study;"High levels of air pollution may be “one of the most important contributors” to deaths from Covid-19, according to research.

The analysis shows that of the coronavirus deaths across 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, 78% of them occurred in just five regions, and these were the most polluted.

The research examined levels of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant produced mostly by diesel vehicles, and weather conditions that can prevent dirty air from dispersing away from a city. Many studies have linked NO 2 exposure to health damage, and particularly lung disease, which could make people more likely to die if they contract Covid-19.

“The results indicate that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the Covid-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world,” said Yaron Ogen, at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany, who conducted the research. “Poisoning our environment means poisoning our own body, and when it experiences chronic respiratory stress its ability to defend itself from infections is limited.”

The analysis is only able to show a strong correlation, not a causal link. “It is now necessary to examine whether the presence of an initial inflammatory condition is related to the response of the immune system to the coronavirus,” Ogen said.

A separate study published on 7 April looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates. Another recent paper noted that the high death rates seen in the north of Italy correlated with the highest levels of air pollution.

The new research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, compared NO 2 levels in January and February in 66 administrative regions with Covid-19 deaths recorded up to 19 March. Ogen also assessed the atmospheric conditions to see where pollution was being trapped over the regions.

He found that 78% of the 4,443 deaths were in four regions in northern Italy and one around Madrid in Spain. These five regions had the worst combination of NO 2 levels and airflow conditions that prevented dispersal of air pollution.

Ogen noted that the Po Valley in Italy and Madrid were surrounded by mountains, which helps trap pollution, as is Hubei province in China, where the pandemic began. “However, my research is only an initial indication that there might be a correlation between the level of air pollution, air movement and the severity of the course of the corona outbreaks,” he said.

Prof Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, said the study showed an association between Covid-19 deaths and NO 2 levels. “This association could reflect a causal link between exposure to air pollution and increased vulnerability to fatal Covid infection, but other factors cannot be ruled out at this stage. For example, the study does not adjust for differences in age distribution in different areas.”

Widespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and air pollution. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution.

In the UK, NO 2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last decade. A key policy to reduce NO 2 levels is the introduction of clean air zones, where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the introduction of some CAZs has been postponed because of the coronavirus crisis.

Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This new study is worrying. We know NO 2 is a toxic gas that inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections, so it may not be surprising that people who have suffered in areas with high levels of NO 2 could be more susceptible to coronavirus.

“This is all the more reason to keep traffic and pollution levels down as much as possible now and get out of this terrible situation with a view to fewer but cleaner vehicles on the road.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/air-pollution-may-be-key-contributor-to-covid-19-deaths-study;2020-04-20T13:17:48
theguardian;On the frontline: meet the NHS workers tackling coronavirus;"“We’re used to death – death is part of life in intensive care – but not in the kind of numbers that we’re seeing, and that’s really quite hard to take,” says Tom Billyard, a consultant at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, as he reflects on the unprecedented challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In preparation for his latest 12-hour shift in ITU, where the worst affected patients are given life support, Billyard begins to don several layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) over his blue scrubs.

First a pair of latex gloves, then a surgical hat. Next a full-length gown tied together at the rear, followed by an additional pair of latex gloves which are meticulously taped on to the sleeves for extra security.

Finally, an FFP3 mask, which grips his face so tightly it will leave red marks across his cheeks, and a yellow-rimmed plastic visor to provide a secondary barrier against the disease.

“I feel trepidation,” he says softly, before entering. “There’s a load of patients in there and I don’t know if they’re going to survive this.”

Struggling for breath



Billyard is one of more than 9,000 employees at the hospital, all of whom – porters and nurses, cleaners and chaplains, consultants and volunteers – have a vital role to play in the treatment of patients and the functioning of the hospital.

Emily Jones, a senior sister in the emergency department (ED), works on the hospital’s frontline. “ED is usually quite noisy,” she says. “But that’s not the case now – you don’t see the patients immediately, until you look through the curtains, and then you realise quite how unwell they can be.

“We’ve had everything from patients who have self-presented at the door saying: ‘I’ve had a cough for a few days,’ to people who have walked up the stairs to get to the emergency department and can barely hold a sentence with you. We’re also getting crews bringing in patients of various ages who are struggling to get breaths while they’re on oxygen.”

The West Midlands is one of the UK’s most affected regions. At the time of writing, UCHW has admitted 568 patients with Covid-19 and recorded 161 deaths from it, while 316 patients have been discharged after making full recoveries. It has transferred its minor injuries unit to a neighbouring hospital, allowing it to prioritise the influx of Covid-19 patients.

“Wow,” Jones says, pausing at the severity of the symptoms she’s treating. “The acuity of our patients has gone up so much. They are so much sicker than we previously saw.”

A blizzard of healthcare staff whirls around her – some reading patient notes, others making telephone calls, washing hands, cleaning everything in sight and, heartbreakingly, placing a picture of a dove on to the door of one of the patients.

“That’s to show they’re on the end-of-life care pathway,” a nurse explains. “It means we should give them peace.”

Isolation

Patients who present with less life-threatening difficulties are often transferred to the respiratory wards on level three for round-the-clock care. There, the eerie silence continues. With no families visiting and the corridors all but empty, it feels like a ghost hospital.

UHCW currently has 84 Covid-positive patients, 12 of whom are in ITU, with 72 designated “query Covid” who are yet to be tested. Some lie in isolation rooms, texting friends and loved ones, others in wards of six beds; many seem in a state of shock and weariness, barely registering the world around them.

Patients and staff on wards 30, 31 and 32.

Mark Anders, a local paramedic, was himself struck down by Covid-19. “We all joked about going to emergency coughs and high temperatures, because that’s all we were going to.”

He fell ill during a Saturday night shift. “I got halfway through the shift and I said to my crew mate: ‘I don’t know what it is; I just don’t feel right,’” he says.

“Then I got home and the temperature started. I had a week at home of self-isolating, looking after myself, taking paracetamol every four hours, fluids, just trying to do everything to keep my temperature down. After a week I couldn’t control it. From there on: nightmare.”

Anders was lucky. As doctors readied him for transfer to ITU, his body began to fight back. Sitting in his pyjamas and still bearing bloody scars around his septum from the oxygen supply that kept him alive, he has been told he can soon return home to his family.

“Massive,” he says, when asked about the value of the NHS. “It’s the first time I’ve been this ill in my life. They have been brilliant.”

Frightened

The first case of Covid-19 in Coventry was on ward 50, the renal ward. Lakhbir Kaur, known to her colleagues as Lacky, has been a sister there for five years. She treated Coventry’s “patient zero” and has watched with concern as the virus has spread through the local community. She fears that it may also transition from patients to staff.

For much of her shift, she wears only an apron, gloves and surgical mask – the kind you would find in a dentist’s surgery.

“It’s scary,” she says. “Our masks already have an expiry date on them and the NHS have covered up the existing expiry date with a further expiry date. What is that? Are they hiding something or are they legitimately tested?

“Infection control have said they have been retested [and are fit for purpose] for another 10 years. I’m wary about that. I really am. I’m a single parent – I’ve got a daughter. She’s the thing I live for. The thought of taking this home from work to her freaks me out.”

UHCW follows guidance on PPE requirements from Public Health England, the government body.

Fiona Wells, who works in infection prevention control, is one of those responsible for dispensing and teaching safe use of PPE. “PPE is an extremely emotive topic,” she says. “People are very frightened about the possibility that it might not be enough.

“Some of the images we see [from abroad] show people dressed up in hazard suits … and it adds to the tension around PPE. But it comes back to the key question: what is necessary? And then using it appropriately.”

Each procedure and each ward might require different levels of protection. In ITU patients might undergo aerosol procedures, which are more likely to spread Covid-19 particles through the air; hence the extra layers of protection worn by Billyard and his colleagues.

Approximately 5,000 UHCW staff have so far been fit-tested for FFP3 masks since January and, though the hospital has plenty of PPE in stock, it relies on unpredictable army drops for replenishment. “We have to carefully manage it to ensure we have the longevity because this pandemic isn’t going to be finished next week,” Wells warns.

Lei Dayrit, a nurse who worked at Hospital of St Cross in Rugby, UHCW’s sister hospital, died from Covid-19-related complications last week. She was one of several nurses who treated an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient who later became symptomatic.

Her death was mourned on Thursday evening during the weekly “clap for carers” gathering outside UHCW, where a banner was unfurled in her honour.

With tears in her eyes, the staff nurse Gail Hobley, a long-time colleague, said: “She was a special nurse to work with. Very caring, very supportive. We had a little discussion about Covid and she said everybody will look after each other, and we are. The support we have from everybody [in the community] is terrific.”

Loved and cared for

In the hospital’s faith centre, the Rev John Matipano, one of the chaplains at UHCW, offers reassurance to those in need.

“We’ve been doing rounds, supporting staff, and we’ve had staff say: ‘Please pray for us’ – something that you would never imagine happening given the way people are quite private about their faith,” he says.

“Even if we don’t speak to staff, if you just go around ED and they see that a chaplain is here, they feel that someone cares, someone is there for them. Now, more than anything else, presence is very important.”

Of all the heartbreak caused by Covid-19, nothing compares with the inability of families to see – and say goodbye to – their loved ones in person. Only in ITU can a dying patient receive one visitor.

Some patients have, at least, been able to communicate with friends and family via video conferencing apps on tablets donated to the hospital. Wells found this especially moving when her grandfather was admitted with Covid-19.

“He was able to tell my family he loved them and to sign goodbye via FaceTime before he died,” she says. “I knew the staff on the ward he was on. They were amazing. They stepped up and fulfilled a role that we weren’t able to fulfil. My mum feels happy that he was well loved and cared for.”

A personal promise



Throughout the hospital, one unexpected sound punctuates the silence: laughter. In these dark times, a joke between colleagues provides a flicker of normality to offset the stress.

Thierno Siedou Diallo, a cleaner, puts it simply: “You must come in and laugh. You give assurance to everybody.”

In the medical decisions unit, Stacey Gavin, a band six sister in acute medicine, is sporting a “bride to be” sash. “I was supposed to be in Benidorm this weekend for my hen do. About 13 of us were going, a mixture of family and friends. Unfortunately it got cancelled about a month ago. So I said if I’m not going on my hen do, I’ll bring my hen do to work.

“The girls put on a little celebration at break time in the staff room. They got Shloer, pretending to be champagne!”

Like most staff, Gavin has offered to worked extra shifts, forgoing her annual leave. She and her colleagues are helped by a group of dedicated volunteers and charity workers, among them Ash Patini.

“I lost my mum 17 years ago to terminal cancer and that absolutely changed my views on life what I wanted to do. She was made to feel very, very happy and comfortable here, right to the very end. It’s something I can never forget.

“I promised myself that one day I would give something back. I kept that vision for 17 years [until taking early retirement]. And that’s why I’m back here; that’s why I do what I do.”

The charity stock room is piled high with donations such as Easter eggs, crips, sweets, fruit bars and toiletries. Elsewhere, local manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover have supplied visors for hospital staff, while many nurses have been given homemade headbands to alleviate the sores caused by wearing face masks.

Privileged position



In preparation for the pandemic, significant changes were made throughout the hospital’s infrastructure: wards were repurposed, staff retrained, junior doctors given greater responsibilities, and strategies put in place to manage the trajectory of the disease.

Kiran Patel, chief medical officer, says: “We’ve probably had about 20 years’ worth of transformation happen in the space of a month. And we’ve probably had over 135 year-one to year-three students, and about 150 graduates, who have basically just hit the ground running and been brilliant.”

Following teleconferences with hospitals in China, Japan and Italy, UHCW has already prepared a reserve ITU ward of 32 beds and could raise capacity even higher, if needed. The hospital has also joined studies run by the World Health Organization.

Nicolas Aldridge, lead nurse for research and development, says: “We’ve been looking at a mixture of anti-viral medications such as hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria medication. We’re gaining large numbers of patients for research because most of the existing research is only from small samples.”

Questioned on Donald Trump’s recent support for the drug, despite limited evidence to support its efficacy in fighting Covid-19, Aldridge says diplomatically: “If we knew it would work, we wouldn’t be doing research on it.”

“Historically, I think the last vaccine took 15 years to create. But technology has moved a huge distance since then and so has our understanding of how vaccines work.

“When you step back at the end of the shift, you realise we’re doing something that’s of immense importance. We’re in a privileged job where we can try to find a treatment for it.”

Quick and painless



In the meantime, testing is critical. UHCW now has a dedicated swab-testing pod which can cater for up to 120 patients a day.

Initially, testing was open to members of the public, but it has recently been scaled back to NHS staff and their families (members of the public can attend neighbouring centres).

“It’s very quick, relatively painless. It’s just uncomfortable,” says the modern matron Amanda Jarvis. “It’s two swabs for an adult: nasal swab and throat – right at the back of the throat. It takes a couple of minutes.”

Leo Harris-Mortimer, four, is swab tested.

Alex Mortimer, a paediatrician, has brought his four-year-old son, Leo Harris-Mortimer, for a test. Leo has had a dry cough for several days; Alex’s wife had previously displayed symptoms, too.

“With this particular illness, the profile is that the older population are much more vulnerable to it, but there are a number of case studies that show children have been infected and have been affected badly. So it’s an important illness to take very seriously,” he says.

The test result takes between 48 and 72 hours to arrive, meaning Mortimer could soon be back in an ambulance if his son gets the all clear. Were it not for this rapid testing, he would have to undergo a precautionary period of isolation, excluding him from service for weeks.

Halfway up Mount Everest



Back in the dimly lit corridors surrounding ITU, nurses and consultants prepare to enter the highly infectious wards. Just like Billyard before them, they too must don – and later doff – every piece of equipment with the utmost precision, otherwise the risk of contaminating themselves, the safe zones and future patients is extreme.

Yellow and black hazard tape marks the flooring – tread on the wrong side of it and you will be quickly admonished – and white plastic sheets with red zippers seal the outer perimeter of the changing zone.

Each person who enters ITU is likely to stay inside for three hours or more before they take a 20-minute break. The sweat caused by wearing so much plastic is instantaneous and the FFP3 masks irritate the nose and skin. Yet there can be no distractions in critical care, where half of all patients with Covid-19 will not survive.

(The NHS says it hopes that by allowing a photojournalist to document the care provided in ITU, it may reinforce the need to stay at home and protect the NHS. Some viewers may find the following images distressing.)

Medics in and around ITU, where signs warn of the extreme infection risk within.

Roger Townsend is the clinical lead for ITU. “Working in the PPE is hot, uncomfortable, and because you can’t take your mask off in the critical care area, you can’t drink a glass of water,” he says.

“There’s always the temptation to do one more job before you leave. So when you say to yourself: ‘I’ll wear this for two hours and then go out and have a drink and then come back in,’ you find sometimes three, four hours have gone by or even longer.”

Inside ITU, many patients are in comas and connected to a vast array of machinery – ventilators, monitors, infusion pumps and sometimes dialysis machines – while groups of nurses and doctors check their vital signs.

Nurses in ITU attend to their patients.

Heart monitors flicker and nurses confer; Billyard wanders the ward, scanning for problems. Many of the patients he surveys are middle-aged.

Behind a curtain, a patient is flipped on to their front – a process known as “proning”. It takes five people to roll one patient. Each of them has their name written across their front and back, because there would be no other way to recognise who was who.

A patient is ‘proned’ – turned on to their front – to assist with breathing.

In another bay, one of the few conscious patients is wearing a pressurised breathing apparatus. His head is entirely encased.

“By the time a patient comes to critical care, they have got the kind of oxygen levels that you would have not quite half way up Mount Everest,” says Townsend, “and that’s on supplemental oxygen to push their oxygen levels up. If we didn’t intervene then the oxygen levels in their blood would fall away and they would die. The intervention that we do is essentially buying some time for mother nature to fix things.”

The hospital has two ITU wards and Townsend reveals the scale of the challenge when he says: “Normally when we hand over at the end or beginning of the day, we might say that two or three patients are really sick, but right now we’ve got 15 or 16 patients on each unit who I would say fit that definition. You do go home shell-shocked.”

Far away from the trauma of ITU, in a scientific laboratory filled with test tubes, refrigerators and unfathomable machines, Ranveer Singh Chaven, a bio medical scientist, is busy analysing results from Covid-19 swab tests.

“Optimism is everything, otherwise you wouldn’t come to work. I’m sure I speak for everyone here at the hospital when I say we’ll work day and night.”

He pauses, then adds: “I keep that with me just to keep me going. If it brings me a second closer to seeing them ... that’s why we do this.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nhs-frontline-meet-people-risking-lives-tackle-coronavirus;2020-04-20T15:24:28

theguardian;Richard Branson offers Caribbean island as collateral for bailout;"Sir Richard Branson has said he will put his private Caribbean island up as collateral in his attempt to persuade the UK government to save his Virgin Atlantic airline from going bust.

Branson, who is the UK’s seventh richest person with an estimated £4.7bn fortune and lives on Necker Island in the tax-free British Virgin Islands, on Monday promised in a public blogpost that he would “raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible”.

Branson, 69, made the pledge as he desperately tried to convince the government to give his airline a £500m bailout to help it through the “devastating impact this pandemic continues to have”.

“The reality of this unprecedented crisis is that many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it,” Branson said in a public blogpost on Monday. “We will do everything we can to keep the airline going – but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for.”

The billionaire has faced mounting criticism for pleading for taxpayers’ cash, rather than using his own fortune to rescue the airline. Branson founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984 and retains a 51% stake alongside the US airline Delta with 49%.

The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Guardian it was unacceptable that “rich billionaires [were] milking the system” at a time of national crisis.

Branson’s fresh plea for taxpayer support comes after the government reportedly rejected Virgin Atlantic’s proposal for a £500m bailout. The Financial Times reported on Friday night that the airline’s initial bid had been rejected and that the airline had been told to explore other ways to raise cash before seeking a state bailout.

Branson said he was pleading for a taxpayer loan, not a handout. “This would be in the form of a commercial loan – it wouldn’t be free money and the airline would pay it back.”

He dismissed the idea that he should consider tapping into his vast personal wealth rather seeking government support.

“I’ve seen lots of comments about my net worth – but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,” he said.

He has pledged to inject $250m (£197m) into Virgin Group, his empire, which stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships and employs about 70,000 people. The pledge – of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline – is 5% of his fortune.

Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.

Branson is the 268th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.9bn paper fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index.

His plea for government cash has prompted a substantial backlash, with many pointing out that the entrepreneur has paid the exchequer no personal income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago.

On Monday, Branson said he and his wife Joan “did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island”.

“Over time, we built our family home here. The rest of the island is run as a business, which employs 175 people. As with other Virgin assets, our team will raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible around the group.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/richard-branson-renews-virgin-plea-for-coronavirus-support;2020-04-20T11:29:50
breitbart;Police Hunt Down, Fine, Man Lying Alone on an Italian Beach;"ROME — Italian police used drones, quads, and a jeep to hunt down and fine a man thought to be spreading coronavirus by lying alone on an Italian beach.

The City of Rimini posted a video of the police action against the sunbather on its website, boasting of the efficiency of local police in bringing the miscreant to justice.

﻿

On Sunday, the Italian news service ANSA reported that photos of the police operation had gone viral, unleashing an unexpected avalanche of fury against the government for its “dictatorial” methods, while others praised the lone bather for his exemplary “social distancing.”

The Italian Interior Ministry reported Monday that 17,500 people were issued citations over the weekend for failing to comply with the Wuhan coronavirus lockdown provisions.

Of the 8,724 who received sanctions on Sunday, 8,641 were fined for traveling outside the home without sufficient justification, 74 for false declarations, and 9 for violated quarantine.

This weekend Italian police stop-checked 197,750 persons and investigated 68,252 businesses, of which 32 were closed down.

breitbart;Video: Denver Health Care Workers Clash with Lockdown Protesters;"Two Denver, Colorado, healthcare employees were caught on camera Sunday blocking protests against the state’s stay-at-home order prompted by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Photojournalist Alyson McClaran told the New York Times that the pair of healthcare employees stood in the street to block protesters that had congregated Colorado capitol for “Operation Gridlock” to challenge Gov. Jared Polis’ (D) lockdown rules.

“They were blocking the roads until the police force stepped in,” McClaran said. “People were putting their cars right up against them.”

One video posted to social media shows a man in scrubs and a mask standing in front of a grey pick-up truck with a woman holding a sign that read “Land of the Free.”

“Go to China if you want communism,” the woman is seen shouting at the man. “You can go to work, why can’t I go to work?”

The worker did not appear to respond.

CPR.org reports:

Coloradans in both political parties have generally given Polis a lot of leeway as he’s exercised extraordinary powers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. But as the weeks of economic and social lockdown continue, opposition is galvanizing. […] This weekend’s protests may bring those sentiments to a new stage. In addition to the Sunday event in Denver, a driving protest is also being organized in Grand Junction Saturday. As of Friday night, Facebook pages for the Denver demonstration showed about 800 people planning to attend, with more interested. The main page, Operation Gridlock Denver, calls for people to stay in their cars and drive around the Colorado state Capitol, halting traffic (Note: As of Saturday afternoon, the Facebook event had been removed) […] The organizers ask attendees to stand apart and wear masks “for everyone’s safety,” while urging policy makers to “Open Everything Now!”

breitbart;WSJ/NBC Poll: Nearly 6-in-10 Concerned About Easing Restrictions Too Quickly;"Nearly six-in-10 registered voters are worried that easing restrictions too quickly during the coronavirus crisis will lead to more deaths, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on Sunday.

That is compared to just 32 percent who are more concerned “that the U.S. will take too long in loosening restrictions, which will harm the economy.”

Bill McInturff, the poll’s GOP pollster, said the national poll is a “powerful signal” that the country is not ready to completely re-open on May 1.

The poll is not an outlier.

As I noted, a Pew Research poll released last week found that “66% of Americans say their greater concern is that state governments will lift restrictions on public activity too quickly” compared to 32% who “say they are more concerned about governments not lifting restrictions quickly enough.”

A Gallup poll conducted last week also found that more Americans are worried about getting the coronavirus than suffering severe financial hardship.

breitbart;Oil Prices Crash as Storage Shortage Looms;"The joke among oil traders Monday morning is that gas stations will soon be paying customers to fill up their tanks as the search for storage options intensifies.

Oil prices plunged on Monday to multi-decade lows. The front-month May contract for West Texas Intermediate futures, which expires Tuesday, fell by more than 36 percent to $11.55 a barrel.

Soon to be expiring contracts are typically traded in lower volumes. Som\e traders may be selling the expiring May contract for fear that storing oil will become more expensive as high production numbers clash with low demand around the globe.

The June WTI contract for West Texas Intermediate futures, fell by more than 11.5 percent. Brent crude oil, considered the global benchmark, fell by around 6 percent.

Analysts are concerned that the capacity for storing oil may run out soon. The storage facility in Cushing, Oklahoma has become a particular focus. Connected by pipeline to Canada, West Texas, the Gulf Coast, and the American Midwest, Cushing is where the physical delivery of most WTI takes place. That end-stage of billions of dollars of daily trading, most of it purely financial and settled with contracts, is becoming more expensive as crude stockpiles have accumulated.

Efforts to curb production, such as a recent agreement between Russian and Saudi Arabia, appear to have fallen short.

When prices for futures contracts expiring further out are higher than contracts expiring sooner, traders describe the market as being in “contango.” The opposite, where near-term contracts are cheaper than long-term, is called “backwardation.” The current market, with a steep discount for oil available for near-term delivery, is known as “super-contang0.” The definitions of those terms may not matter to most consumers but they are fun to say.

“Uncontained contango,” is a new phrase being thrown around to describe super-contango driven by lack of storage capacity.";http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/04/20/oil-price-crash/;2020-04-20T00:00:00

faz;Tom Tugendhat and Norbert Röttgen want a Friendship-Treaty;"Brexit marks the chance for a new beginning. The chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Comittes of the Bundestag and the House of Commons make the case for a German-British Friendship Treaty. A guest column.

EU-Supporters gather on Brexit-Day in front of the British Embassy in Berlin Bild: EPA

More than three years after the referendum, Brexit on Saturday became reality as the United Kingdom formally left the European Union. After 40 years of European integration and being an integral part of a community as tightly intertwined as the EU, this departure not only fundamentally changes the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU. It also requires us to rethink the bilateral relations between EU member states and the UK. While we have different perspectives on Brexit, we agree that it is now time to move on.

Many aspects of our future relationship will be organized at the European level as part of the ongoing Brexit negotiations. But some issues are bilateral and require stronger direct ties. We think it’s time for a German-British Friendship Treaty, which regulates enhanced cooperation and strengthens our shared values, cultural and educational policy and, yes, our foreign affairs. A treaty would complement whatever the UK agreed with the 27 member states and deepen our bonds.

One of the first consequences of Brexit will be that officials, ministers and parliamentarians from our two countries will no longer regularly meet in Brussels. We need to make sure understanding remains strong and encourage exchanges between us. Ramping up our embassy staff and the cultural and educational programmes run by institutions such as the Goethe Institute, the British Council or the German Academic Exchange Service can also change the tone.

Irrespective of the UK’s decision on remaining a full member of the Erasmus exchange programme after 2020, we should strengthen direct ties between German and British students and teachers and deepen scientific cooperation between our researchers. Creating new bilateral grants to fund joint projects no longer eligible for EU funding would promote collaboration and could culminate in shared clusters of excellence at German and British universities.

Shared enterprise will boost much more than science and the economy, it will further entwine our values. Germany and the United Kingdom are home to some of the most tolerant and open societies in the world. And yet racism in general, and anti-Semitism in particular, are on the rise in our societies. To counter this we should launch a joint, high profile project that fights intolerance and promotes solidarity.

For different reasons, taking a strong stance against anti-Semitism has particular importance for both societies: to Germans it is central to our historical responsibility for the horrors of the Second World War; to Britons forcefully condemning anti-Semitism it is a recognition of the proud history the UK has of providing refuge to Jews fleeing from prosecution and death in Nazi Germany. As important allies of Israel and on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the time to act is now.

Finally, Germany and the United Kingdom have shared interests overseas. Our two countries stood together on every major international issue, from global trade to the Iran nuclear deal. We both recognise that we share a continent, values, making our security indivisible. Geography and geopolitics is not changed by Brexit. For both of us, security in the Middle East has direct implications for the stability of our own societies, and those of our neighbours. As part of a wider initiative, as Europeans, or within the E3 format alongside France, Germany and the UK will no doubt cooperate in political and military engagements in the region, from working to stabilize Iraq, to helping to support parties trying to bring peace to Libya.

With Britain’s EU membership coming to an end it is time to look ahead and to create a strong foundation for our future bilateral relations. A German-British Friendship Treaty would provide a framework. It will be the first draft of the next chapter which we will write together.";https://www.faz.net/aktuell/brexit/tom-tugendhat-and-norbert-roettgen-want-a-friendship-treaty-16613158.html;2020-02-02T15:04:24

This is about you, the survivors and I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am that you are here and in some cases, here with your children and grandchildren. Five years ago, when I stood here, in front of these painful gates, I admitted that I am not a survivor: But I am so grateful for the survivors who are here today. I am not a liberator, although I salute the courage of the veterans who saved us all.

I am here, simply, as a Jew. And, like all Jews everywhere, this place, this terrible place called Auschwitz has sadly become an inseparable part of us.

Auschwitz is like a scar from a terrible trauma. It never goes away and the pain never stops. I have always wondered, if I had been born in Hungary, where my grandparents were from, instead of New York in February, 1944, would I have lived?

The answer is: no.

I would have been one of the 438,000 Hungarian Jews gassed by the Nazis in 1944 right here in Auschwitz. I can assure you, almost all Jews have pondered this question.

75 years ago today, when Soviet troops entered these gates, they had no idea what lay behind them. And since that day the entire world has struggled with what they found inside.

We have all wondered how an advanced country that gave the world great literature and art and scientific advancement, could sink to an anger, a meanness, a depravity like Auschwitz.

I’m afraid Auschwitz offers more questions than answers.

But let me be clear: While Germany and Austria caused, created and carried out this shattering evil practically every other European country helped the Nazis gather up their Jewish citizens. Too many people in too many countries made Auschwitz happen.

And when European Jews begged the world for a safe harbor, someplace to go, the entire world turned its back on them.

Even my own country - the beacon of freedom - turned out its light on the jewish people when they needed it the most.

The U.S. organized a conference in Evian, France, in July of 1938, to discuss the Jewish refugee crisis. There were a lot of lovely speeches but, the United States did not let any additional Jewish refugees in and every other country in attendance followed their lead.

There were 32 countries and none of them, except for the tiny Dominican Republic wanted anymore Jews. Hitler saw this. Four months later, came Kristallnacht.

And again, there was no world reaction.

Hitler tested the world. And at every step he saw the truth: the world did not care. That’s when he knew that he could build this factory of death.

Evian led to Auschwitz. Kristallnacht led to Auschwitz. World Anti-Semitism led to Auschwitz.

Thankfully, there were some people throughout Europe who had a moral decency and who acted differently. Ordinary people who risked their lives and their family’s lives, to save other human beings sometimes people they didn’t even know.

At Yad Vashem in Jerusalem you will see 27,362 names of what we call: The Righteous Among Nations. Those gentiles, who risked everything to save Jewish lives. We have not forgotten these honorable men and women and we never will.

Five years ago, at the 70th anniversary, I was very concerned about the shocking rise of Anti-Semitism here in Europe. Today, you all know the attacks on Jews, the killings, the vicious slanders have only grown worse, and they have even spread to my country.

75 years ago, when the world finally saw the pictures of the gas chambers here and the piles of bodies, nobody in their right mind wanted to be associated with Nazis. But now, I see something I never thought I would see in my lifetime: The open and brazen spread of Anti-Jewish hatred throughout the world, once again.";https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/ronald-s-lauder-s-speech-at-auschwitz-16603174.html;2020-01-27T16:35:51
faz;Facebook: Splitting up is not the solution;"The biggest disadvantage for European tech companies compared to their Chinese and American competitors is the absence of a large-scale domestic market. A guest contribution.

Everybody agrees that the internet needs new rules – from those governing how people’s private data is handled, or how the integrity of elections is preserved, to the mechanisms for allowing data to flow between companies and nation states or how harmful content is identified and taken down. These decisions will determine whether the norms and standards of the internet are created on a global level, preserving the open, accessible and universal internet of today, or whether individual countries will diverge further from each other, creating their own rules and systems, turning themselves into walled gardens and ending the universal global internet as we know it.

But we in Europe and the West are not the only ones grappling with decisions about the future of the internet. As we speak, there is a fight for the soul of the internet already underway. In fact, another internet already exists. The Chinese internet – one based on very different values: state control; censorship; and surveillance. And some other countries, to greater or lesser degrees, are beginning to follow China’s lead.

Europe may not have its own Silicon Valley, or be as advanced in large scale AI as China or the West Coast of the United States, but it is a thought leader when it comes to the future of the internet. GDPR was the first serious attempt to create a set of principles and rules around private data in the digital age. And those principles are at the heart of a vision for the internet that I believe is shared among all open societies: that it is accessible to all; transparent and accountable; that you control your own data; and that competition and innovation should be encouraged.

Facebook wants to add its voice

In the US, the political debate is around whether big tech companies should be broken up. Here, in the EU, it is largely about how tech companies should be better regulated. In both cases, the fundamental question is the same: how can the power of large tech companies be held to account?

Facebook wants to add its voice to this debate in a constructive way. We are not resisting regulation – the opposite, in fact. Regulating the tech sector is a far more effective way to ensure that tech serves the needs of society than simply chopping successful companies into bits. We have not only long accepted the need for new regulation in a host of areas, we are impatient to get going.

It is now time we moved beyond words and towards action. A new EU Commission is in post, a new Parliament has been elected, and a great regulatory challenge lies before us. My message to European policymakers is: Everyone agrees the internet needs new rules. We want them, just as you do. So let’s get to work.

One area where we should work together is data portability. The reason is simple: if we want a competitive, open internet where new services can compete with large platforms like Facebook, we have to enable to people to move their data from one service to a competing one.

You're not giving us your data

It is a subject we have been working on with policymakers in Germany. Last year we held a series of round table discussions hosted by Stiftung Datenschutz and attended by government and industry representatives, privacy experts, civil society and data protection authorities, which resulted in a report that raised a number of questions and recommendations for how to move forward.";https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/netzkonferenz-dld/facebook-splitting-up-is-not-the-solution-16586463.html;2020-01-19T14:54:53
faz;Quantum Tech: Future Directions;"These are early days in quantum technologies. It is clear, that this field will have a significant impact on a wide range of economic sectors.

Model of the inside of a quantum computer Bild: Bastian Benrath

We are entering a new era which will catalyze discoveries in science and technology. Novel computing platforms will probe the fundamental laws of our universe and aid in solving hard problems that affect all of us. Machine learning programs powered by specialized chips are already yielding breakthrough after breakthrough.

Quantum computing is part of the larger field of quantum information science (QIS). All three branches of QIS – computation, communication, and sensing – are advancing at rapid rates and a discovery in one area can spur progress in another.

Businesses and investors are now ramping up their interest in these fields. In this piece, we will first outline the various quantum technologies and then cover opportunities and impact. While these are early days in quantum tech, we can see exciting possibilities coming down the road. In the past three years alone, funds invested more than $650 million into quantum tech companies. The quantum tech ecosystem is growing rapidly in many geographies across the globe and is not dominated by just one or two locations.

Quantum communication leverages the unusual properties of quantum systems to transmit information in a manner that no eavesdropper can read. This field is becoming increasingly critical as quantum computing drives us to a post-quantum cryptography regime: quantum computers of sufficient size will be able to break many cryptographic schemes currently in use, which means that new protocols will need to be developed and put into use.

An emerging class of sensors

There are quantum-resistant schemes currently being tested – for example, as part of the NIST process – for which there are no known quantum (or classical, for that matter) attacks. For ultimate security, however, it may be that some will choose to rely on new quantum communication protocols that make use of a new quantum internet. Those protocols will be guaranteed secure by the fundamental laws of physics, but will require new hardware beyond what we currently use for classical data transmission.

Quantum sensing is a robust field of research that uses quantum devices to move beyond classical limits in sensing magnetic and other fields. For example, there is an emerging class of sensors for detecting position, navigation, and timing (PNT) at the atomic scale. These micro-PNT devices can provide highly accurate positioning data when GPS is jammed or unavailable.

Quantum sensors also show promise in the life sciences. Researchers have already demonstrated the use of nanoscale quantum sensors to measure the electromagnetic activity of single cells. We can use these sensors to monitor the firing of neurons and cardiac cells. These technologies can develop into cornerstone diagnostic and therapeutic devices in the future.

The trick is to build such a system

One of the critical differences between quantum and classical computation is that in quantum computing we are manipulating quantum states themselves; this gives us a much larger computing space to work in than in classical computers. In classical computers, if we wish to model a real-world quantum physical we can only do so with representations of such a system and we cannot implement the physics itself. This key difference leads to exciting possibilities for the future of computing and science. All this starts with fundamental truths about our world that were developed during the quantum mechanics revolution in the first half of the 20th century";https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/netzkonferenz-dld/quantum-tech-future-directions-16586824.html;2020-01-19T11:10:00
